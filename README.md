# Aqil's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation was to hone my frontend skills as a developer. To achieve that motivation, I built this Study Guide Webpage to document and track what I have learned.

One of the things I learned was how to use GitHub, as well as markdown which will come in very handy in my journey towards becoming a well-rounded frontend developer.


## Installation

N/A


## Usage

Each section will have my notes on the different aspects/technologies used in frontend development namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git

There are no images but I'm leaving in the following part as a reminder of how to do it.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)


## Credits

N/A


## License

MIT License (Please refer to the LICENSE in the repo)

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
